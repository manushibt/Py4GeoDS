# Course Summary

This is a one-month weekend course on fundamentals of machine learning and its python-based implementation with geospatial data use cases. The classes will be on weekends and during the weekdays the candidates are expected to work on their tailored project which will be guided by our instructor. If you have doubts regarding the assignments/project, don't worry we have arranged a counseling lecture for you every Wednesday (Evening/Night session). 

The materials, 

    - You will get all the lectures recorded on our albedo foundation android app so don't worry if you skip the lecture
    - You will get python scripts which were taught during the course work and the guided manual of the course work
    - You will get the solution scripts of the assignments too!
    - Individual counsiling sessions regarding the projects
    - The whole course will be a live online class so you can interact with the instructor and feel free to ask your doubts immediately 

The course prerequistes are, 

    - Working knowledge of remote sensing & Geospatial fundamental concepts. 
    - Basic computer knowledge & working computer
