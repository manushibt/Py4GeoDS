# Course Summary

This is a weekend course so that you don't have to worry about your daily schedule or work-frame. Our course instructor will teach you the Python basics needed for the GIS and programming related to the GIS data handling and visualization on weekends (2 weekends) and also provide the assignments regarding the taught concepts for your practice. 
If you have doubts regarding the assignments don't worry we have arranged a counseling lecture for you every Wednesday(Evening/Night session). 

The materials, 

    - You will get all the lectures recorded on our albedo foundation android app so don't worry if you skip the lecture
    - You will get python scripts which were taught during the course work and the guided manual of the course work
    - You will get the solution scripts of the assignments too!
    - The whole course will be a live online class so you can interact with the instructor and feel free to ask your doubts immediately
